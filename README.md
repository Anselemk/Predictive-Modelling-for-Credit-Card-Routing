# Predictive-Modelling-for-Credit-Card-Routing
To help the business to automate the credit card routing through predictive model by increasing the payment success rate and keeping the transaction fees low.

Project Name: Credit Card Routing for Online Purchase via Predictive Modelling

Project Description: This project focuses on automating the credit card routing process in online retail by leveraging predictive modeling techniques. By developing a model that predicts the best payment service provider (PSP) for each transaction, we aim to increase the success rate of online credit card payments while minimizing transaction fees.

Project Overview: The project addresses the challenge of high failure rates in online credit card payments. By analyzing historical transaction data, we will build a predictive model that considers various factors such as transaction amount, customer location, time of transaction, and PSP performance history. This model will enable intelligent routing of transactions to the most suitable PSP, leading to improved payment success rates and customer satisfaction.

Features: 
  -Predictive Modeling: Utilizing historical transaction data to build a model that predicts the optimal PSP for each transaction.
  -Intelligent PSP Routing: Automatically routing transactions to the most suitable PSP based on factors such as transaction success rates, transaction fees, and PSP performance history.
  -Continuous Learning and Adaptation: The model will continuously learn and adapt from new transaction data, improving its accuracy and reliability over time.

Technologies Used: In this project, Python programming language is used. Libraries include Numpy, pandas, tensorflow. Git repository has been used as well.


Usage: Install the above mentioned dependencies and set up the project environment.
Provide the necessary input data, including transaction details and PSP performance history.
Run the predictive model to obtain the recommended PSP for each transaction.
Implement the recommended PSP routing logic in the online payment system.
